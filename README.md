CareSync Health Network — Metadata-Driven Data Platform on Azure & Databricks
An end-to-end, metadata-driven data engineering project for a multi-hospital healthcare network. It ingests relational data from an internal hospital system (PostgreSQL) alongside recurring file-based feeds from external partners (CSV), then transforms everything through a Bronze–Silver–Gold medallion architecture on Databricks — all driven by a single reusable Azure Data Factory pipeline configured entirely from a SQL control table, with every run automatically audited and reported by email.

Architecture
CareSync end-to-end architecture

Data flows from the source systems on the left through ingestion, transformation, and out to consumption, with orchestration, governance, and CI/CD wrapped around the pipeline rather than sitting inside it:

Ingestion — Azure Data Factory, driven by metadata rather than one pipeline per table.
Transformation — Databricks (PySpark, Delta Lake), through Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
Orchestration — Azure Data Factory pipelines plus a SQL database holding the control/metadata and audit tables.
Governance & Security — Unity Catalog, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Logic Apps for automated email notifications.
CI/CD — GitHub, for both the Azure Data Factory and Databricks repos.
Consumption — Databricks AI/BI Dashboards, Genie Agents, and Genie ONE.
Key Features
Metadata-driven ingestion — a single Azure Data Factory pipeline ingests every source, relational or file-based, based on rows in a SQL control table. Onboarding a new source means adding a row, not writing a new pipeline.
Full and incremental loads — full-reload, append, and watermark-based merge load strategies, all handled by the same generic notebooks.
Bronze–Silver–Gold medallion architecture — raw, standardized, and curated reporting layers on Delta Lake, with a supporting calendar dimension table.
Automated auditing & alerting — every stage of every run is logged, and a status email (with a dynamic subject and an HTML results table) goes out automatically via Azure Logic Apps, whether the run succeeds or fails.
Governed, credential-less storage access — Unity Catalog storage credentials and managed identities throughout; no account keys or passwords in any pipeline definition.
CI/CD for both platforms — feature-branch and pull-request workflows for Azure Data Factory and Databricks Repos alike.
Multiple consumption surfaces — a multi-page Databricks dashboard, a scoped Genie Agent, and a workspace-wide Genie ONE natural-language interface, all built on the same gold tables.
Repository Structure
Folder	Contents
01_Sources Data/	Sample source data and setup scripts — Postgres source table DDL/seed data (01_postgres/) plus initial and incremental sample CSV drops for the external partner feeds (02_adls_csv/).
02_Metadata Table Queries/	DDL and seed scripts for the ctrl schema — table_config, watermark, and audit_log, the control tables that drive every pipeline run.
03_Gold STTM/	The source-to-target mapping workbook used to design and generate the gold-layer notebooks.
04_Azure Data Factory Repository/	The full ADF Git-integrated repo — pipelines, datasets, linked services, and factory/publish config.
05_Databricks_Repository/	The Databricks notebooks — Landing-to-Bronze, Bronze-to-Silver, the calendar dimension builder, and the three Gold-layer reporting notebooks.
